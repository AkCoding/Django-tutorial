It is responsible for maintaining data. It is the logical data structure behind the entire application and is represented by a database (generally relational databases such as MySql, Postgres).

Here are the major files and their explanations. Inside the geeks_site folder ( project folder ) there will be the following files-&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-77.png\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>manage.py- </strong>This file is used to interact with your project via the command line(start the server, sync the database… etc). For getting the full list of commands that can be executed by manage.py type this code in the command window-&nbsp;</p><pre>$ python manage.py help</pre><p>&nbsp;<strong>folder ( geeks_site ) – </strong>This folder contains all the packages of your project. Initially, it contains four files –&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-78.png\" alt=\"\"></p><ul><li><strong>_init_.py – </strong>It is a python package. It is invoked when the package or a module in the package is imported. We usually use this to execute package initialization code, for example for the initialization of package-level data.</li><li><strong>settings.py – </strong>As the name indicates it contains all the website settings. In this file, we register any applications we create, the location of our static files, database configuration details, etc.</li><li><strong>urls.py – </strong>In this file, we store all links of the project and functions to call.</li><li><strong>wsgi.py – </strong>This file is used in deploying the project in WSGI. It is used to help your Django application communicate with the webserver.</li></ul><div class=\"textBasedMannualAds_2\"><p></div></div>"
