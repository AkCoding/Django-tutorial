    "<p>After getting to know the basics of <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/\">Python</a>, one should know when to use Django and why?&nbsp;<br>Django is a high-level python based web framework which allows you to quickly create web applications without all of the installation or dependency problems that you normally will find with other frameworks.&nbsp;</p><p>One should be using Django for web development in the following cases:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For developing a Web Application or API Backend.</li><li>For Rapid Development of some web application.</li><li>Deploying the application Fast and Scaling it according to your needs</li><li>A Perfect ORM for working with databases instead of database queries</li><li>To develop a secure single-page application for either retrieving data or posting data.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><figure class=\"table\"><div class=\"inArticleAds\"></div><table><thead><tr><th><p style=\"text-align:center\">Django</p></th><th><p style=\"text-align:center\">MEAN/MERN</p></th><th><p style=\"text-align:center\">Spring</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Python</td><td>JavaScript</td><td>Java</td></tr><tr><td>Open Source</td><td>NoSQL Databases</td><td>Open Source</td></tr><tr><td>Great Community</td><td>Modularity</td><td>Powerful</td></tr><tr><td>Easy to Learn</td><td>Mongoose</td><td>Dependency Injection</td></tr><tr><td>MVT Based</td><td>Organized</td><td>Stability</td></tr><tr><td>Batteries Included Framework</td><td>Dynamic Front End</td><td>MVC</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h4>Django is a good choice when:</h4><p>1.You need to build a robust, scalable web application with a lot of data. Django’s built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and support for database migrations make it easy to work with large amounts of data, and its built-in admin interface makes it easy to manage that data.<br>2.You need to build an application with a lot of user-facing functionality. Django’s built-in forms, authentication, and authorization make it easy to implement user registration, login, and other common functionality.<br>3.You need to get an application up and running quickly. Django’s “batteries-included” philosophy means that it comes with a lot of built-in functionality, so you can get an application up and running quickly without having to write a lot of boilerplate code.<br>4.You want to use Python for your backend. Since Django is built on Python, it’s a natural choice if you’re already familiar with the language or want to use it for your backend.</p>"

    "<h4>When compared to other development stacks, Django may not be the best choice for certain types of projects. For example:</h4>\n",
    "<p>1.If you’re building a small, simple website or a single-page application (SPA), a JavaScript-based framework like React or Angular might be a better choice.<br>2.If you’re building a real-time, highly-concurrent application, a framework like Node.js might be a better choice since it is built on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.<br>3.If you’re building a mobile application, you’ll probably want to use a mobile-specific framework like React Native or Xamarin.<br>Ultimately, the choice of web development stack will depend on the specific requirements of your project and your team’s expertise. Django is a great choice for many types of web applications, but it may not be the best choice for every project.</p>"
